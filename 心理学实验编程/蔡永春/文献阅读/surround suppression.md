### Background

---

1. antagonistic interactions between center and surround regions of the receptive fields of many **direction-selective** neurons in visual cortex.
2. the size of a **high-contrast** moving pattern renders its direction of motion **more difficult to perceive** and **reduces its effectiveness as an ==adaptation stimulus==**.

### Introduction

---

1. spatial antagonism of motion signals observed at high contrast **gives way to spatial summation** as  contrast decreases. 
2. Thus, if center-surround antagonism is an ***integral*** part of motion processing, we should **expect to see** a perceptual signature of this antagonism in the form of impaired motion visibility with increasing stimulus size. (No matter large or small size)
3. increasing the size of a **low contrast** moving stimulus **enhances** its visibility, presumably owing to spatial summation. 
4. physiological descriptions of center–surround motion neurons have been obtained with **high contrast** 
	motion.
	* 3 and 4 describe the psychophysical results
5. in the visual cortex, the nature of center–surround interactions is often ***dependent*** on contrast: surround suppression is stronger at high contrast and spatial summation is more pronounced at low contrast
	* 5 describes the neuron results, which also echoes with ***integer*** in 2
6. threshold **contrast measurements** might not fully describe the spatial properties of human **motion perception**, especially at high contrast.

### Experiments

---

* **Experiment 1**

	1. purpose: measure the threshold exposure duration required for human observers to accurately identify the motion direction of a drifting Gabor patch.

	2. methods: 

	  * Gabor patch width ranges from 0 degree to 5 degree, with 6 groups of different contrasts(2.8%, 5.5, 11, 22, 46, 92)
	  * Gabor patch:
	  	* spatial specialty: sf = 1cycle per degree, speed = 2 degree per sec.
	  	* time duration control: temporal gaussian envelope.

	3. results:

	4. Duration thresholds as a function of stimulus size at different contrasts. 
	
	   Duration thresholds as a function of contrast for a range of stimulus sizes
	
	5. shifts: 2.7 degree (foveal)
	   	5% contrast (==MT neurons attain about 25% of their maximum response on average==)

### Experiment 2

---

1. Similar contrast-dependent size effects were obtained with faster moving stimuli ($8\degree s ^{-1}$) and with Gabor patches whose spatial bandwidth was held constant by scaling spatial frequency (1 cycle
    per $\delta$) 增加速度和sf不改变exp1的结论

2. the presence of noise actually improved the visibility of large-motion stimuli

3. random-dot displays also support surround suppression

4. First, foveal presentation yields evidence for surround suppression. As eccentricity increased, duration thresholds decreased for all sizes.
     More importantly, the size dependence of duration thresholds changed systematically with eccentricity, with almost no effect at the largest eccentricity tested.

### Experiment 3

---

1. By adjusting the magnitude of an abrupt phase shift, we can replicate the duration threshold findings.
2. This result is surprising in that colour-defined motion with large stimuli was actually perceived more accurately than luminance-defined motion, presumably because the latter is affected by surround suppression. Thresholds for isoluminant stimuli, however, decreased with increasing size, exhibiting spatial summation.(整个图像恒定亮度和有对比度的情况)

### Experiment 4

---

1. 周边抑制=>降低神经元对大量运动刺激的反应活动=>对运动敏感的中央-外周神经元的适应性会减弱=>测量到的MAE减弱
2. 高对比度下，测量到MAE减弱=>存在周边抑制

### Other Findings

	Dividing a large high-contrast object into smaller parts actually improved performance in a speed discrimination task, leading to the suggestion of surround suppression as one possible explanation. 

2. Increasing the contrast of a briefly presented, large drifting grating decreased performance24, agreeing with a portion of our findings (filled diamonds in Fig. 1b). 

3. Brief motion stimuli, by virtue of their broad temporal frequency spectrum, might therefore stimulate motion filters tuned to opposing directions of motion. At high contrast, these paired filters could saturate impairing direction identification;  however, this fails to explain the effects of size that are central to the present study. Moreover, paired opponent filters cannot explain the MAE results (Fig. 4) that generalize our principal findings to prolonged motion stimuli. (阈值的时间很短，使得频谱很宽，而短暂宽频谱的信号会导致motion filters将运动信号调谐到相反方向。但是这个不能解释周边抑制的核心——size，而且MAE的测量说明这是会延续的)

### 从心理物理现象到神经层次的推论，认为该实验反映了神经元的特性）

出于几个原因，我们认为我们的结果可能反映了MT中中央-外周神经元的感受野特性。

首先，较大刺激下的视觉表现受损被认为是中央-外周拮抗机制所预期的知觉特征

其次，我们开始观察到强烈周边抑制的 "临界大小"（图 1b）足够大，足以影响具有中央凹感受野的 MT 神经元的周边（图 1d）。然而，这一临界大小远大于初级视觉区（V1）的感受野，也远小于 MST 区（内侧上颞区）外侧部分的感受野，MST 区是 MT 以外包含中央-外周运动神经元的皮层区域。

第三，刺激大小的不利影响在视觉外围会减弱，这与 MT 感受野的大小随偏心率的增加而增大是一致的。第四，MAE（一种至少部分归因于 MT 活动的知觉后效应）在大的高对比度刺激诱导下会减弱。如果这种刺激抑制了MT神经元的活动，而MT神经元的适应通常有助于MAE，那么这种结果是意料之中的。

最后，MT神经元对孤立光栅运动的反应比对亮度光栅运动的反应更弱，这一特性与孤立光栅运动不能产生周边抑制的现象非常吻合。

### 实验进行所根据的假设

1. 运动感知能力和神经元活动水平有关
2. 由于感受野大小和偏心率的变化，大型运动物体所引起的周边抑制强度不会发生实质性改变。
3. 结果来源于中央外周神经元，而不是Wide-field（解剖学结果

### 实验结果带来的预测

1. 恒亮刺激的反应强度遵循spatial summation
2. 预测神经元的活动也是依赖对比度的

### 结语

While in low contrast, high sensitivity is essential, which lead to spatial summation. While in high contrast, the sensory input is strong enough for guarantee visibility, so surround suppression is computationally important.
