### Background

---

1. antagonistic interactions between center and surround regions of the receptive fields of many **direction-selective** neurons in visual cortex.
2. the size of a **high-contrast** moving pattern renders its direction of motion **more difficult to perceive** and **reduces its effectiveness as an ==adaptation stimulus==**.

### Introduction

---

1. spatial antagonism of motion signals observed at high contrast **gives way to spatial summation** as  contrast decreases. 
2. Thus, if center-surround antagonism is an ***integral*** part of motion processing, we should **expect to see** a perceptual signature of this antagonism in the form of impaired motion visibility with increasing stimulus size. (No matter large or small size)
3. increasing the size of a **low contrast** moving stimulus **enhances** its visibility, presumably owing to spatial summation. 
4. physiological descriptions of center–surround motion neurons have been obtained with **high contrast** 
	motion.
	* 3 and 4 describe the psychophysical results
5. in the visual cortex, the nature of center–surround interactions is often ***dependent*** on contrast: surround suppression is stronger at high contrast and spatial summation is more pronounced at low contrast
	* 5 describes the neuron results, which also echoes with ***integer*** in 2
6. threshold **contrast measurements** might not fully describe the spatial properties of human **motion perception**, especially at high contrast.

### Experiments

---

* **Experiment 1**

	1. purpose: measure the threshold exposure duration required for human observers to accurately identify the motion direction of a drifting Gabor patch.

	2. methods: 

	  * Gabor patch width ranges from 0 degree to 5 degree, with 6 groups of different contrasts(2.8%, 5.5, 11, 22, 46, 92)
	  * Gabor patch:
	  	* spatial specialty: sf = 1cycle per degree, speed = 2 degree per sec.
	  	* time duration control: temporal gaussian envelope.

	3. results:

	4. Duration thresholds as a function of stimulus size at different contrasts. 
	
	   Duration thresholds as a function of contrast for a range of stimulus sizes
	
	5. shifts: 2.7 degree (foveal)
	   	5% contrast (==MT neurons attain about 25% of their maximum response on average==)

### Experiment 2

---

1. Similar contrast-dependent size effects were obtained with faster moving stimuli ($8\degree s ^{-1}$) and with Gabor patches whose spatial bandwidth was held constant by scaling spatial frequency (1 cycle
    per $\delta$) 增加速度和sf不改变exp1的结论

2. the presence of noise actually improved the visibility of large-motion stimuli

3. random-dot displays also support surround suppression

4. First, foveal presentation yields evidence for surround suppression. As eccentricity increased, duration thresholds decreased for all sizes.
     More importantly, the size dependence of duration thresholds changed systematically with eccentricity, with almost no effect at the largest eccentricity tested.
